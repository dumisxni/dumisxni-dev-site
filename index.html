    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! I'm Dumisani, a Computer Science and Computer Engineering student at the University of Cape Town. My passions include software development, AI, and solving complex problems. I enjoy tackling challenging projects that allow me to learn new technologies and develop practical solutions.</p>
    
    <p>Throughout my academic career, I have developed strong problem-solving skills, which have helped me excel in areas like data structures, algorithms, and computational theory. I have also gained experience in programming languages such as Python, Java, and C#, and have applied this knowledge in several personal and academic projects.</p>

    <p>Beyond the classroom, I am passionate about working on open-source projects and collaborating with like-minded individuals. I believe in the power of teamwork and collaboration in achieving great results. In my free time, I enjoy reading about the latest advancements in technology, experimenting with new programming languages, and contributing to various tech communities.</p>

    <p>Looking forward, I aspire to work in the field of artificial intelligence, where I can apply my skills to create intelligent systems that can solve real-world problems. My long-term goal is to contribute to cutting-edge research and innovations that improve people's lives.</p>
